# GameVault Configuration Reference

Two layers of configuration:

1. **Environment variables** (`GAMEVAULT_*`) — set at container start, used
   for paths, secrets, and tuning.
2. **`app_settings` DB table** — runtime preferences set via the web UI
   (API keys, Special K path, tone-map settings, password hash).

DB values **override** env vars when both are set for the same key.

For installation see the main [README.md](../README.md). For per-feature
behavior see [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md).

---

## Environment Variables

All env vars use the `GAMEVAULT_` prefix and are loaded by `pydantic-settings`
in [backend/config.py](../backend/config.py). They can also be set via a
`.env` file in the project root.

### Required (effectively)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GAMEVAULT_SECRET_KEY` | auto-generated on first run | JWT signing key. If left default, GameVault generates a random 32-byte hex key on first boot and persists it to `/data/.secret_key` so tokens survive restarts. Set this explicitly to a long random value (e.g. `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`) for production deployments. |
| `GAMEVAULT_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public URL for share links. Set to your real public URL or share previews on Discord/Slack/etc. won't work. |

### Paths

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GAMEVAULT_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Holds `gamevault.db`, `.secret_key`, thumbnails directory, library. |
| `GAMEVAULT_LIBRARY_DIR` | `/data/library` | Per-game folders with `screenshots/`, `thumbnails/300/`, `thumbnails/800/`, `metadata/`. Mount on a separate drive if you want screenshots elsewhere. |
| `GAMEVAULT_DB_PATH` | `/data/gamevault.db` | SQLite database file (WAL mode). |

### Authentication

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GAMEVAULT_DISABLE_AUTH` | `false` | If `true`, all auth checks are skipped. Only safe behind a trusted reverse proxy that does its own auth. |
| `GAMEVAULT_TOKEN_EXPIRY_DAYS` | `30` | JWT lifetime. Tokens are not revocable, so shorter is more secure if you don't have separate session management. |

### Optional API Keys

These can also be set in the UI (Settings → API Keys). DB-stored values
take precedence over env vars.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GAMEVAULT_STEAM_API_KEY` | Steam Web API key. Faster screenshot discovery + richer Steam Store metadata. |
| `GAMEVAULT_STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY` | High-quality cover art from SteamGridDB. |
| `GAMEVAULT_IGDB_CLIENT_ID` | Twitch/IGDB client ID for non-Steam metadata. |
| `GAMEVAULT_IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Twitch/IGDB client secret. |

### Tuning

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GAMEVAULT_IMPORT_RATE_LIMIT_MS` | `1000` | Delay between Steam HTML requests during import. Lower = faster but may hit Steam's rate limiter. |
| `GAMEVAULT_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` | `50` | Per-file upload limit. Web requests over this return HTTP 413. |
| `GAMEVAULT_THUMBNAIL_QUALITY` | `85` | JPEG quality (1-100) for generated thumbnails. |
| `GAMEVAULT_CORS_ORIGINS` | `""` | Comma-separated list of additional origins beyond the localhost defaults. Required if you serve the frontend from a different host than the backend. |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Container timezone. Affects timestamps in logs and the `taken_at` displayed in the UI. |

### Auto-managed

These are set automatically and rarely need overriding:

- `GAMEVAULT_DATA_DIR`, `GAMEVAULT_LIBRARY_DIR`, `GAMEVAULT_DB_PATH` are
  baked into the Docker image.

---

## DB-stored Preferences (`app_settings` table)

Schema: `(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT NOT NULL)`. Managed via the
Settings page and the `PUT /api/settings/preferences` /
`PUT /api/settings/api-keys` endpoints — don't write directly.

### Preferences (set via `PUT /api/settings/preferences`)

| Key | Type | Range / Values | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `specialk_path` | string | any path | `""` | Pre-fills the Special K Import page. Server-side path. |
| `tone_map_algorithm` | enum | `reinhard` \| `aces` \| `clip` | `reinhard` | Used when generating SDR thumbnails for HDR sources. |
| `tone_map_exposure` | float | `0.05` – `8.0` | `1.0` | Multiplier applied before tone-mapping. |

Tone-map settings are read by [`image_processor.py`](../backend/services/image_processor.py)
on each thumbnail generation, opening a fresh sqlite connection
(synchronous) since the surrounding Pillow code is synchronous. Changes
take effect on the next thumbnail generated; existing thumbnails are not
regenerated.

### API Keys (set via `PUT /api/settings/api-keys`)

| Key | Notes |
|---|---|
| `steam_api_key` | Plain-text storage. |
| `steamgriddb_api_key` | "" |
| `igdb_client_id` | "" |
| `igdb_client_secret` | "" |

The `get_effective_key(name)` helper reads the DB first, then falls back
to the matching env var on the `Settings` Pydantic object. Used wherever
metadata or scraping code needs an API key.

### Auth-managed

- `auth_password_hash` — bcrypt hash of the user's password. Set by
  `POST /api/auth/setup` and `POST /api/auth/change-password`. Cleared
  only by direct DB manipulation.

---

## Tone Mapping in Practice

Setting `tone_map_algorithm` and `tone_map_exposure` only affects future
thumbnail generation. To regenerate existing thumbnails after changing
these settings, you currently need to:

1. Note the IDs of the screenshots you want to regenerate
2. Delete the entries (`DELETE /api/screenshots/{id}` removes files)
3. Re-import or re-upload the originals

A bulk-regeneration endpoint is not implemented (yet). If you want one,
file an issue.

### Algorithm reference

| Algorithm | Formula | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `reinhard` | `x / (1 + x)` | Soft rolloff. `0 → 0`, `1 → 0.5`, `∞ → 1`. The default. |
| `aces` | Narkowicz approximation | Filmic curve, slightly more contrast and saturation. |
| `clip` | `min(x, 1.0)` | Hard clip. Fastest, blows highlights. |

After tone-mapping, the linear-ish output is encoded with the sRGB OETF
(industry-standard for SDR displays).

```

The `screenshots/` directory holds the **original** files at their native
format and resolution. The `thumbnails/` directory holds the SDR JPEG
derivatives shown in the UI. HDR JXR/PNG screenshots are downloaded from
the gallery as the original file via `GET /api/screenshots/{id}/image`.

---

## Backups

Everything that matters lives under `GAMEVAULT_DATA_DIR`. To back up:

```bash
docker stop gamevault
cp -r /mnt/user/appdata/gamevault /mnt/user/backups/gamevault-$(date +%Y%m%d)
docker start gamevault
```

WAL mode means hot copies are usually safe, but stopping is safer. The
database file (`gamevault.db` plus `-wal` and `-shm` siblings during
operation), all images, and the secret key are all in `DATA_DIR`.

To restore: stop GameVault, copy the backup tree to `GAMEVAULT_DATA_DIR`,
start GameVault. No migrations or extra steps.

---

## Migrations

Schema changes are applied automatically on startup by
[backend/migrations/runner.py](../backend/migrations/runner.py). Migrations
are listed in order in `MIGRATIONS`; an `_migrations` table tracks which
have been applied so they only run once.

Current migrations:

- `m001_initial` — all core tables, indexes, FTS5 virtual table, triggers
- `m002_gallery` — adds `is_public` column to `games`
- `m003_specialk` — adds `specialk_import_sessions` table

To add a new migration: create `mNNN_<name>.py` with an
`async upgrade(db)` function and append it to `MIGRATIONS` in
`runner.py`. Migrations run inside a single connection — if `upgrade`
fails the migration record won't be inserted, so it'll be retried next
boot.

---

## Reverse Proxy Notes

GameVault is a single FastAPI app on port 8080 (configurable via
uvicorn's `--port`). All endpoints are under `/api`, `/share`,
`/assets`, or static SPA files. Standard reverse-proxy config works:

- WebSockets are not used; SSE is over plain HTTP
- For SSE to work through nginx, set `proxy_buffering off;` (the
  `X-Accel-Buffering: no` response header tries to do this automatically)
- If proxying to a different hostname, set `GAMEVAULT_BASE_URL` to your
  public URL
- Set `GAMEVAULT_CORS_ORIGINS` if your frontend is served from a
  different origin
